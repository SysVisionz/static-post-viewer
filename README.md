# Static Post Viewer

The SysVisions Static Post Viewer is a lightweight, highly customizable Wordpress plugin for displaying your blog list in a quick and easy fashion, with a large number of options, including 

* The number of post previews in each row
* The number of rows displayed in each section
* Whether or not to load more posts, and whether they load with a button or automatically as you scroll down the page
* Whether or not to include a timestamp, the excerpt, and the author's name, and if they should be listed as their username even if they have a personal name with their account
* Whether or not to include the post's featured image, and the aspect ratio of it in the thumbnail displayed
* The maximum image container height and width.
* Whether to switch the image's automatic orientation. The image is automatically oriented to the left when rows are set to only contain 1 post, and to the top if they include more.
